# Project Overview

This is a web-based application used to read RSS feeds.
It has [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) included already, enabling test running.
The objective of this project is to become familiarized with testing an app, by using Jasmine.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

This Project is a part of the Udacity Nanodegree program to become a Front End Developer.

The objetive of this project is to try using Jasmine to perform Testing on the app developed.

As for documentation [here you can take a look at the project rubric!](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/18/view)

## How to use it?

First you must clone the project or download it al zip file.
Then you just have to open the **index.html** file on your browser, and see for yourself that Jasmine's tests are passed!.
No need to put Jasmine On, as it has already been included in file.


## Contributing

As this is my first testing app code using Jasmine, you may find that many of the loops and code could probably be better, so once the project gets submitted and hopefully approved, feel free to contribute with anything that optimizes code or even helps me improve my coding skills welcome!

## Usability

All game components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers without any installation required.
